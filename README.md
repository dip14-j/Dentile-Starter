# Dentile-Starter Description

Dentile is a medical website template for dentists, healthcare professionals, and companies that offer medical services. It has 7 attractive HTML pages. It is designed using the Bootstrap v4 framework.

The white canvas gives the impression of hygiene in a medical center. Not only this, but it also gives a feeling of peace and compassion. The template does a fine job of instantly gaining the trust of the visitors. So that the design does not look pale, our designers have also added speckles of dark, punchy colors in the form of CTA buttons and icons. The colors also give good visibility to important buttons.

It also has a fixed top header with crucial contact information.

# Impactful Home Page
With a wide banner, informative cards, call to action buttons, number counters, and a consultation form, the home page gives you opportunities to make the most out of it. You can also link a promotional video of your services on the page.

# Featured Services
Apart from an exhaustive services page that gives you scope to add plenty of details for every kind of service you provide, there is also a featured services widget at the bottom of the about page. You can list expert or freshly launched services there.

# Contact Form on Landing Page
Having a contact form on the landing page opens you to a wider set of visitors. If you can make a lasting impression with your landing page, you can expect to increase your conversions exponentially.
